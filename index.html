			<h3>We need canned food in go bags because it provides a long-lasting, non-perishable, and nutrient-rich food source that is easy to prepare during emergencies. This is crucial when fresh food is unavailable and cooking facilities may be out of service, allowing you to sustain yourself until help arrives or you reach a safer location. </h3>
